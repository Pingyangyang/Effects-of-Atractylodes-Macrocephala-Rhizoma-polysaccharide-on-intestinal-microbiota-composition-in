Description: After taking blood from the abdominal aorta, the rats were quickly executed by cervical dislocation. Under aseptic conditions, the caecal content was taken with sterilized forceps and placed in a 5 mL sterile EP tube, numbered, weighed, and quickly placed in liquid nitrogen. After the sample is collected, move it to - 80 ℃ for storage.
Take the caecal content. The total DNA in content was extracted in strict accordance with the DNA extraction kit. Nanodrop spectrophotometer was utilized to quantify DNA (DNA quantitative analysis), and the purity and concentration of the extracted genomic DNA were identified by electrophoresis. Amplification was performed using the 16S rDNA V3-V4 variable region, and the Quant-it PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit was used for fluorescence quantification. For further fluorescence quantification, samples should be combined in the appropriate proportions. Afterward, Illumina's NovaSeq 6000 sequencer was utilized for double-end sequencing of rat caecal contents.

Variables:
Length of the sequence：the coding length of DNA genes. The size of 
gene molecules in the range of 400-500bp is moderate and the mutation  
rate is small, which is the most commonly used and useful marker in the
 taxonomy of bacterial systems.

Count：the intestinal contents microbiota
